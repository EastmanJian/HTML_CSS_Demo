    <span>R</span>obert Pattinson may be famous for playing a vampire in the Twilight series, but he seems a lot more
    predatory and a lot less healthy in Good Time: you can almost smell the sweat dripping from his gaunt, pasty,
    pop-eyed hustler as he cheats and robs his way around the grubbier corners of New York. And there is more to this
    outrageous urban crime farce than Pattinson’s career-best performance. A fizzing cocktail of audacious style and
    painfully raw authenticity, the film marks out its directors, Josh and Benny Safdie, as two of America’s most
    exciting and distinctive new talents.
